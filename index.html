        <div class="text">
            <p>
            My first memory of a computer was in Seoul, where I was born and raised until the age of 8. We had a black square television, heavy and frumpy, sitting low to the ground in the middle of our living room. Back then, its height was comparable to that of me and my brother. Here, we watched <span class="koreanfont hover-text" data-target="img-1">Korean comedy shows</span>, Spongebob, and other animations.
            <br>
            <br>

            Then one day, my dad led us to one of the bedroom doors in excitement. He said, “I have something to show you”. He revealed a white computer on a desk. My brother and I sat on the ground, necks arched up towards the too-high desk to watch the first film of The Chronicles of Narnia. 
            <br>
            <br>

            In school, we had started learning to type in computer lab. <span class="koreanfont hover-text" data-target="img-2">The software program</span> had a character that would frown or smile to reflect my typing progress and I felt motivated to impress my virtual teacher. On our new computer back home, my mom made me an email address (bigeyes0421 - don’t ask lol) on Hanmai, originally operated by Daum, but now merged with Kakao. My uncle and dad helped me make my first social media account on Cyworld. 
            <br>
            <br>
                
            <span class="koreanfont hover-text" data-target="img-3">Cyworld (싸이월드, Ssaiwoldeu)</span>, short for Cyber World and a play off of the Korean word cy (사이, sai), which means between or in relation to, consisted of <span class="koreanfont hover-text" data-target="img-4">mini bedrooms (미니홈피, minihompy)</span> as the main feed. They allowed a wide range of customization for the bedrooms with themes and items that could be purchased using acorns (도토리, dotori), their official cyber currency. My minihompy was underwater themed with a whale spouting a heart in the center. I remember feeling so giddy when I was gifted a song to go with my bedroom, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7OJ9LnboCY"><span class="koreanfont hover-text" data-target="img-5">Loveable by Kim Jong Kook</a></span>, that would play automatically when someone visited my room. The interface was designed to resemble a journal with the bedroom being the first default tab and other tabs including a photo album, journal entry, and more. Unlike today’s social platforms that automatically update a home feed with other people’s content to scroll incessantly, Cyworld’s main feed was yourself. If you wanted to see other people’s content, you had to visit their minihompy (like a profile) and could be done one at a time. 
            <br>
            <br>

            I was unable to recover or find my Cyworld. It holds fond memories of the early internet, true to archiving and exploration. Now there are efforts to relaunch Cyworld in 2025 and perhaps there is hope that I can recover my account from 20 years ago.

            <p>Fullerton, CA<br>
                2006-2011<br><br>

                My family moved to Southern California in the spring of 2006. We lived in Fullerton for most of my childhood and my brother and I were often home alone. Here, we didn’t have a laptop, a computer, or even access to the internet.<br><br>

                I still don’t really understand how TV cables work, but we used an antenna to crank and twist at just the right angle to watch our favorite shows. Our go-tos shows were Malcolm in the Middle, Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader, and if we were really lucky, our favorite, The Simpsons. I loved the opening theme song and always hoped that they would show the long version of the intro instead of skipping to the couch scene. 
                <br><br>

                My brother and I spent a lot of time worldbuilding by merging Lego and Bionicle and often included our stuffed animals as townspeople in this enmeshed town. For my brother’s birthday, he was gifted a pink Nintendo, the only color available at our local GameStop, so it was embellished with black pointy stickers to supposedly offset the feminine look. I watched my brother finish his quest on Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass multiple times and when I finally felt brave enough to try, he guided me through the dungeon because I was too scared of the virtual phantoms to do it alone. We also played Brain Age, somehow unfazed by the floating Asian head hounding us to be better at math, and Pokemon the Pearl version. I found more joy in watching my brother play Nintendo: jumping, holding breath, clenching, and cheering with him to live the stories of our virtual characters. 
                <br><br>

                Our childhood was a mix of digital and physical play. It was the kind where we would gift each other Pokemon cards from Target and compare their stats on Nintendo. My brother would fold origami, including a dragon, waterbombs, and treasure chests that he would hide around the park for me and my friends to find. Inside would be paper cutouts of green or red gems, just like the ones you would see from Legend of Zelda.
                <br><br>

                I always thought that I had a pretty lackluster childhood, just trying to survive through the motion and weight of the world as a family of new immigrants. But looking back, I find richness and love in creativity, something my brother shared with me every step of the way.

                This is an archive of all the bedrooms I have occupied: <br>
                From my earliest memory to present day. 
                <br> 
                <br> 
                In these spaces, I have shared, crafted, founded, <br>
                and lived much of my physical days as well <br>
                as my digital days. From my very first encounter <br>
                of the internet to now writing my own lines of code, <br>
                my digital presence and its relation <br>
                to self have shifted as much as I did in the physical.
                <br>
                <br>
                Scroll horizontally to go down my memory lane, <br>
                a deep dive of cross-continental spaces and <br>
                 their corresponding memories of the internet, <br>
                digital artifacts, and me throughout the years.
